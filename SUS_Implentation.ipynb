There was no challenge in doing so.  It was generally intuitive in doing so. Could have probably added a prompt on which date corresponded to create the task and which was the due date, maybe right above each selected date, but otherwise it was easy to guess which was which.  I would have preferred not an expanding menu because I wasn't sure which options were located in which menu, but once I figured it out then it was easy to find within the individual menu.   It was generally intuitive in finding where things are. I didn't have much difficulty in finding where things were even when they were not in the most intuitive location.  I like it better than the existing platform because it feels like I know where things are more easily.                                                          4                                            2                                        4                                                                     1                                                                    4                                                           1                                                                               4                                                     2                                          4                                                                              1"
