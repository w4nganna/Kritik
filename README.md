# Kritik UI design

Kritik is an educational platform dedicated to enhancing critical thinking through peer assessment and iterative processes. In this project, we focused on identifying potential areas for UI improvements by blending human insight with technological innovation. As a team, we addressed the challenges of the current interface, particularly for instructors responsible for creating and scheduling activities—by concentrating on improving the UI for university educators. This process pushed me to learn Figma and sparked a newfound passion for UI design, culminating in a high-fidelity prototype that truly embodied our vision.

After identifying areas of frustration through user testing, we conducted usability testing with five participants from university teaching teams to assess the new design. Our approach combined quantitative metrics (errors, task completion time, number of clicks) with qualitative feedback (structured interviews and post-observation questionnaires) to evaluate learnability, efficiency, memorability, and overall satisfaction.

**Key Findings:**  
- **Navigation Issues:** Participants found the grouping of sections confusing due to non-intuitive dropdown headings.  
- **Formatting Tools:** Legibility issues with toolbar labels resulted in moderate difficulties in task completion.  
- **Scheduling Challenges:** The range calendar did not align with users’ mental models for setting deadlines, posing a high-impact problem.

Despite these challenges, the prototype achieved a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 74.5—above the industry average—indicating overall positive user sentiment.

**Recommendations:**  
- **Reorganize Feature Groupings:** Use clearer, more intuitive labels for dropdown menus to improve navigation.  
- **Enhance Formatting Tools:** Improve the legibility and descriptive clarity of toolbar icons.  
- **Revise Calendar Interface:** Adjust the range calendar to better match the target users’ mental models of deadlines.

Implementing these recommendations in future iterations will further streamline the user experience and reinforce Kritik’s mission of continuous, peer-driven learning. Click image below for a walkthrough.
